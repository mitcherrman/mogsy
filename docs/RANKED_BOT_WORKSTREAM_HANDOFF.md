# Ranked Bot workstream — handoff

Status: **RB1 complete** (backend + frontend, tested, not yet published/deployed).

## Objective

Bot Ranked is **canonical Ranked against a server-controlled opponent**. It is
not a mode, not a product, and not a second implementation. Access is:

```
admin (operator override)  OR  account whose CURRENT effective entitlement is Premium
```

The entitlement is read live rather than copied into a tag, so a temporary
Premium grant handed out by another workstream automatically confers bot
access, and its lapse automatically removes it again. Nothing here has to know
either happened.

## Invariants

* **No separate bot renderer.** A match id enters the same Ranked host and the
  same arena/question/result UI whether its opponent is human or a bot.
* Same Ranked match creation and lifecycle, question generation, renderers,
  Mastery/Matchup/Combat slices, scoring, arena and result pipeline.
* **Unrated**, and skipped at the authoritative rating-eligibility layer — not
  by the caller's intention. No Elo, no ladder effect.
* **Server-authorized.** `match_with_bot` in the request body is a *request*.
  The frontend capability is visibility only.
* Fails closed. An entitlement that cannot be resolved never authorizes — and
  is reported as an outage, not as a Free account.

## Current implementation

### Backend (`League_Combat_Simulator`)

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `routes/ranked_public.py` | `POST /api/ranked/queue`; `_authorize_ranked_bot()` is the gate; `is_request_admin()` is the override; `_create_admin_bot_match()` builds the match |
| `services/entitlement.py` | `Capability.can_play_ranked_bot`, `require_ranked_bot()`, `resolve_capability()` |
| `services/pro_status.py` | PT1.4 effective Pro (`stripe_pro OR valid grant`) via the self-scoped `my_pro_entitlement()` RPC; raises `ProLookupError` on an indeterminate answer |
| `schemas/ranked_public_schemas.py` | `QueueJoinIn.match_with_bot` (`extra="forbid"`) |
| `ranked_public/service.py` | `create_bot_match`, `drive_bot_match` — unchanged |

Wire codes:

* `RANKED_BOT_NOT_AUTHORIZED` → **403**, the caller is understood and refused.
* `RANKED_ENTITLEMENT_UNAVAILABLE` → **503**, entitlement indeterminate. Access
  is still withheld; a 403 here would tell a paying customer they never paid.

### Frontend (`mogsy`)

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `src/hooks/useRankedBotAccess.ts` | Resolves `canPlayRankedBot` from `useAdminRoles` + `fetchProEntitlement`. Fails closed on loading, signed-out and unresolved |
| `src/components/quiz/play-scroll/RankedPlayScroll.tsx` | The wired boundary; holds the capability so the view stays pure |
| `src/components/quiz/play-scroll/PlayScrollRecord.tsx` | Passes `canPlayRankedBot` straight through |
| `src/components/quiz/play-scroll/RankedQueueView.tsx` | The one switch, its copy, and the modified join |
| `src/lib/ranked-public/client.ts` | `joinQueue(classId, signal, { matchWithBot })` — the only creation call |
| `src/pages/quiz-ranked/useRankedQueue.ts` | `joinWithoutClass({ matchWithBot })`; `matched` → the existing handoff |
| `src/pages/dev/play-scroll/PlayScrollPreviewPage.tsx` | `Bot access` chip stands in for the capability |

The view is never told which tier the viewer is in — only whether they may use
Bot Ranked — so a future rule that opens the switch some other way changes
nothing below the boundary.

## Completed in RB1

1. Backend authorization widened from admin-only to **admin OR effective
   Premium**, consuming the existing PT1.4 resolver rather than a new tag.
2. `RANKED_ENTITLEMENT_UNAVAILABLE` (503) added so an outage is fail-closed
   *and* honest.
3. Frontend: finished a partial prior change (`canPlayRankedBot` was already
   being passed to a view that still declared `isAdmin`, which did not
   typecheck), renamed the prop through `RankedQueueView` and the dev preview.
4. Copy: `"Admin test: a bot opponent…"` → `"A bot opponent, starting
   immediately. Ordinary Ranked, unrated."`, and the control now reads
   `Match with Bot · Starts immediately · Unrated`. It says neither "admin" nor
   "Premium": Premium is the entitlement, not the name of the match.
5. Parity safeguard: a structural + behavioural regression test that a bot
   match id enters the same Ranked host, and that the host holds no bot branch.
6. Stale docstrings describing Bot Ranked as "admin-only testing" updated in
   the route, the schema and the client.

UI shape is unchanged: one switch under the Ranked entry, OFF on every open, no
difficulty, no bot class, no bot identity, no response-speed setting, no
separate card, no new route. The human queue stays the primary action.

## Tests

Backend (`/Users/macmoney/League_Combat_Simulator/.venv/bin/python`, from the
repo root):

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest test_ranked_bot_premium_access.py -q
```

15 passed — admin preserved (and needing no entitlement lookup), Premium
non-admin succeeds on the same creation path with an identical match row, Free
gets a typed 403 and is not quietly queued, forged headers/body change nothing,
an unresolvable entitlement is 503 and never 403, and the ordinary human join
is unchanged for both tiers and never asks about entitlement at all.

Regression, compared as failure **sets** against a clean `origin/master`:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest test_ranked_admin_bot_match.py test_ranked_public_queue.py \
  test_ranked_public_queue_routes.py test_ranked_launch_readiness.py test_ranked_prototype.py \
  test_rg1_match_lifecycle.py test_rg1_role_end_to_end.py test_ranked_admin_bot_display_name.py \
  quiz/tests/test_practice_builder.py quiz/tests/test_personal_analytics.py \
  quiz/tests/test_free_snapshot_projection.py quiz/tests/test_pro_status.py \
  engine_tests/test_combat1_playtest_entitlement_bridge.py -q
```

99 failures before, the **same** 99 after. They are the repo's known
environment baseline (the modern format's shared-bank pools are not seedable
from these fixtures), not RB1's.

Frontend:

```bash
npx vitest run --no-file-parallelism src/components/quiz/play-scroll src/pages/quiz-ranked \
  src/lib/ranked-public src/hooks/useRankedBotAccess.test.ts
npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.app.json
```

`tsc` goes from 17 pre-existing errors to 15: RB1 **removed** the two the
partial prior change had left and introduced none.

> Run vitest **serially** (`--no-file-parallelism`). Parallel runs in this repo
> fabricate failures.

## Next task — RB2: Ranked vs Bot parity audit

1. Play a representative normal Ranked flow and a Bot Ranked flow.
2. Compare presentation and state behaviour side by side.
3. Identify any bot-specific drift.
4. Focus on the **end-of-match screen** — the owner already suspects it is the
   weakest part.
5. Bot Ranked should visually and behaviourally emulate normal Ranked wherever
   opponent-specific information does not genuinely require a difference.

RB2 is an audit; do not begin the visual/end-screen redesign inside RB1.

### After RB2 — RB3: playtest preset/tag

Layer playtest-specific orchestration and interstitials **on top of** Bot
Ranked without forking the Ranked renderer. The backend already has
`pro_grant_kind='playtest'`, and a playtest grant resolves as Premium, so a
playtester already has bot access today with no new mechanism.
